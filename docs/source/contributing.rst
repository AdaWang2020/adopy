Contributing
============

The basic process of ADOpy development follows the `Gitflow workflow by Vincent
Driessen`_, which holds two main branches: ``master`` and ``develop``.
Only an exception is that we use ``feature/*``, ``hotfix/*``, or ``release/*``
instead of ``feature-*``, ``hotfix-*`` or ``release-*``.
There are a bunch of great resources about Gitflow and we require you to read
at least one of them before proceeding.

If you want to contribute to ADOpy, you can start with forking the ADOpy
repository in the GitHub. Before you start writing a code, please make a new
issue for what you want to do. Then, following the Gitflow, you should make a
proper branch to work with. We only allow feature branches for who is not
authorized. If your job is done, you can make a pull request on the ADOpy
repository and let us review it before merging it.
