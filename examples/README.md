# Examples using ADOpy

Here, we provides some examples using ADOpy. Two kinds of examples will be uploaded:

1. Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) with interactive results of using ADOpy, and
2. Python scripts for experiments using [PsychoPy][psychopy].

## Prerequisites

If you want to try by yourself, you should prepare [Jupyter][jupyter-install] for `*.ipynb` or [PsychoPy][psychopy-install] for experimentation codes first.

[jupyter-install]: https://jupyter.org/install.html
[psychopy]: https://www.psychopy.org/
[psychopy-install]: https://www.psychopy.org/download.html#pip-install
